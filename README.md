# Python Stock Analysis Tool
This is the final project for my Python with Data Science college course and is currently a WIP.
The data set is being supplied by Yahoo Finance API.

My goal is to allow the user to choose which stock to view and to enable data analysis using CandleStick or OHLC charting, and allow for custom periods of time for analysis. In addition I will consider the time and space complexity and improve the program to allow the most efficient processing possible.


UPDATES:

    * Completely changed the project by learning dash from a tutorial (see credits). Charts now display selected stocks and allow some manipulation.
