# PythonStockAnalysis
This is my final project for my Python with Data Science class and is currently a WIP.
The data set is from https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/sandp500

My goal is to allow the user to chose which stock to view from the S&P 500 fund, and to analyze the data using OHLC charting. In addition I will consider the time and space complexity and improve the program to allow the most efficient processing possible.
