# PythonStockAnalysis
This is my final project for my Python with Data Science class and is currently a WIP.
The data set is being supplied by Yahoo Finance API.

My goal is to allow the user to chose which stock to view and to enable data analysis using CandleStick or OHLC charting. In addition I will consider the time and space complexity and improve the program to allow the most efficient processing possible.
